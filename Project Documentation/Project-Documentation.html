<p class="p-p1">SYNOPSIS</p>
<p class="p-standard"><span class="s-t">Title: - </span><span class="s-t1">Jobster</span><span class="s-t2">: Connecting Jobs to Seekers</span>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p-p2"><span class="s-t">Introduction: -</span><span class="s-t3"> </span><span class="s-t4">Jobster</span><span class="s-t5"> is a </span><span class="s-t6">job</span><span class="s-t6"> portal based application </span><span class="s-t5">where various job seekers and recruiters can connect to each other and apply/share jobs based on respective fields of interest. As the tagline goes, the motive is to let seekers connect to their dream jobs based on their interests. The Application lets the seekers to build up their profile and search for vacancies on the platform as well as provides the recruiters with the opportunity to add, build up their company's profile and share vacancies. However, both of these services requires the user to sign-up and provide up with relevant details before accessing above facilities.</span>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p-p2"><span class="s-t">Objectives: -</span><span class="s-t7"> </span><span class="s-t5">The main objective is to let the seekers search and apply for their dream jobs in an easy and efficient manner. Mainly this idea was derived from </span><span class="s-t8">naukri.com</span><span class="s-t5"> where multiple users from all over the world search for variety of jobs. However, the only limitation is the &nbsp;lack of interaction between the two entities which leads to an inactive and inefficient mechanism. So, thus here on Jobster, seekers can easily sign-up and apply for their dream jobs which is even simple and clear to go through. Moreover, the Employers can have an interaction with the seekers if their profile interests them.</span>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="p-p1">REQUIREMENT ANALYSIS</p>
<p class="p-p8">2.1 FEASIBILITY STUDY</p>
<p class="p-p9">Feasibility Study means the analysis of problem to determine if It can be solved effectively. In other words, it is the study of the possibilities of the proposed system it studies the work ability, impact on the organization ability to meet user’s need and efficient use of resources.</p>
<p class="p-p10">Three aspects in which the system has to be feasible are: -</p>
<p class="p-p10">1. ECONOMICAL FEASIBILITY:</p>
<p class="p-p10">The economic analysis checks for the high investment incurred on the system. It evaluates development &amp; implementing charges for the proposed Project. The S/W used for the development is easily available at minimal cost &amp; the database applied is freely available hence it results in low cost implementation.</p>
<p class="p-p10">2 TECHNICAL FEASIBILITY:</p>
<p class="p-p11">This aspect concentrates on the concept of using Computer Meaning, “Mechanization” of human works. Thus, the automated solution leads to the need for a technical feasibility study. </p>
<p class="p-p11">The focus on the platform used database management &amp; users for that S/W.</p>
<p class="p-p11">The proposed system doesn’t require an in-depth technical knowledge as the system development is simple and easy to understand. The S/W used makes the system user friendly (GUI). The result obtain should be true in the real time conditions.</p>
<p class="p-p10">3. BEHAVIOURAL FEASIBILITY:</p>
<p class="p-p11">Behavioral feasibility deals with the run time performance of the S/W the proposed system must score higher than the present in the behavioral study. The S/W should have end user in mind when the system is designed while designing S/W the programmer should be aware of the conditions user’s knowledge input, output, calculations etc.</p>
<p class="p-p11">The S/W contains only a minimum no. of bugs. Care is also taken to avoid non-working means &amp; buttons.</p>
<p class="p-p12">2.2 SOFTWARE REQUIREMENT SPECIFICATION DOCUMENT</p>
<p class="p-p13"><span class="s-t9">A </span><span class="s-t10">Software Requirements Specification</span><span class="s-t9"> (SRS) is a document that describes the nature of a project, software or application. In simple words, an SRS document is a manual of a project provided it is prepared before starting a project/application. This document is also known by the names SRS report, software document. A software document is primarily prepared for a project, software or any kind of application. </span>&nbsp;</p>
<ul class="wwnum1_"><li class="calibre1"><p class="p-p14"><span class="s-t11">Introduction:</span><span class="s-t9"> The project titled as “Jobster: Connecting Jobs to Seekers” will be developed using Spring MVC, and MySQL.

<p class="p-p12">2.3 SDLC MODEL USED</p>
<p class="p-p20"><span class="s-t9">In a practical software development project, the classical waterfall model is hard to use. So, Iterative waterfall model can be thought of as incorporating the necessary changes to the classical waterfall model to make it usable in practical software development projects. It is almost same as the classical waterfall model except some changes are made to increase the efficiency of the software development.</span>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p-p21">The iterative waterfall model provides feedback paths from every phase to its preceding phases, which is the main difference from the classical waterfall model.</p>

<p class="p-p12">3.1 PRODUCT PERSPECTIVE</p>
<p class="p-p24">The project titled as “Jobster” will be developed using Spring MVC, Spring Security and MySQL. The aim is to build an application that can be used to search as well as apply for jobs in an easy and efficient manner.</p>
<p class="p-p12">3.2 PRODUCT FUNCTIONS</p>
<p class="p-p25">Once the user signs up in the application, based upon the selected role, next page is delivered for letting the user fill up the additional information. For Job Seekers, the next web-page is to fill up their additional details and complete their profile. While, for the recruiters the next web-page is to &nbsp;add/fill up information for their organization. Once the information is saved, the recruiter can access the feed using which he/she can add up the vacancies on behalf of their organization. While the job seekers can search for their desired job using a set of filters in their respective feed.</p>
<p class="p-p12">3.3 USER CHARACTERISTICS</p>
<p class="p-p24">The System processes data over secure channel exhibiting both authentication and authorization. The User credentials are saved in encrypted manner using SHA.</p>

<p class="p-p35">4.3 Testing</p>
<p class="p-p36">Testing is a process of executing a program with the aim of finding error. To make our software perform well it should be error free. If testing is done successfully it will remove all the errors from the software.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="p-p37">Principles of Testing:-<a id="calibre_link-1" class="calibre3"></a><a id="calibre_link-2" class="calibre3"></a></h3>
<p class="p-p38"><span class="s-t13">(i) All the test should meet the customer requirements<br class="calibre4" />
(ii) To make our software testing should be performed by third party<br class="calibre4" />
(iii) Exhaustive testing is not possible. As we need the optimal amount of testing based on the risk assessment of the application.<br class="calibre4" />
(iv) All the test to be conducted should be planned before implementing it<br class="calibre4" />
(v) Start testing with small parts and extend it to large parts.</span>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 class="p-p37">Types of Testing:-<a id="calibre_link-3" class="calibre3"></a><a id="calibre_link-4" class="calibre3"></a></h3>
<h4 class="p-p39">1. Unit Testing<a id="calibre_link-5" class="calibre3"></a><a id="calibre_link-6" class="calibre3"></a></h4>
<p class="p-p40">It focuses on smallest unit of software design. In this we test an individual unit or group of inter related units.It is often done by programmer by using sample input and observing its corresponding outputs.<br class="calibre4" />
Example:</p>
<p class="p-p41">a) In a program we are checking if loop, method or </p>
<p class="p-p42">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="s-t14">function is working fine</span>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p-p43">b) Misunderstood or incorrect, arithmetic precedence.</p>
<p class="p-p43">c) Incorrect initialization</p>
<h4 class="p-p39">2. Integration Testing<a id="calibre_link-7" class="calibre3"></a><a id="calibre_link-8" class="calibre3"></a></h4>
<p class="p-p40">The objective is to take unit tested components and build a program structure that has been dictated by design.Integration testing is testing in which a group of components are combined to produce output.</p>
<p class="p-p40">Integration testing is of four types: (i) Top down (ii) Bottom up (iii) Sandwich (iv) Big-Bang<br class="calibre4" />
Example</p>
<p class="p-p41">(a) Black Box testing:- It is used for validation. </p>
<p class="p-p43">In this we ignores internal working mechanism and </p>
<p class="p-p44"><span class="s-t15">focuses on </span><strong class="s-t12"><span class="s-t15">what is the output?</span></strong><span class="s-t15">.</span>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p-p45">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p-p43">(b) White Box testing:- It is used for verification. </p>
<p class="p-p43">In this we focus on internal mechanism i.e.</p>
<p class="p-p44"><strong class="s-t12"><span class="s-t15">how the output is achieved?</span></strong>&nbsp;</p>
<h4 class="p-p39">3. Regression Testing<a id="calibre_link-9" class="calibre3"></a><a id="calibre_link-10" class="calibre3"></a></h4>
<p class="p-p40">Every time new module is added leads to changes in program. This type of testing make sure that whole component works properly even after adding components to the complete program.<br class="calibre4" />
Example</p>
<p class="p-p41">In school record suppose we have module staff, students </p>
<p class="p-p43">and finance combining these modules and checking if on </p>
<p class="p-p43">integration these module works fine is regression testing</p>
<h4 class="p-p39">4. Smoke Testing<a id="calibre_link-11" class="calibre3"></a><a id="calibre_link-12" class="calibre3"></a></h4>
<p class="p-p40">This test is done to make sure that software under testing is ready or stable for further testing<br class="calibre4" />
It is called smoke test as testing initial pass is done to check if it did not catch the fire or smoked in the initial switch on.<br class="calibre4" />
Example:</p>
<p class="p-p41">If project has 2 modules so before going to module </p>
<p class="p-p43">make sure that module 1 works properly</p>
<h4 class="p-p39">5. Alpha Testing<a id="calibre_link-13" class="calibre3"></a><a id="calibre_link-14" class="calibre3"></a></h4>
<p class="p-p46"><span class="s-t13">This is a type of validation testing.It is a type of&nbsp;</span><em class="calibre5"><span class="s-t13">acceptance testing&nbsp;</span></em><span class="s-t13">which is done before the product is released to customers. It is typically done by QA people.<br class="calibre4" />
Example:</span>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p-p41">When software testing is performed internally within</p>
<p class="p-p43">the organization</p>
<h4 class="p-p39">6. Beta Testing<a id="calibre_link-15" class="calibre3"></a><a id="calibre_link-16" class="calibre3"></a></h4>
<p class="p-p40">The beta test is conducted at one or more customer sites by the end-user of the software. This version is released for the limited number of users for testing in real time environment<br class="calibre4" />
Example:</p>
<p class="p-p41">When software testing is performed for the limited</p>
<p class="p-p43">number of people</p>
<h4 class="p-p39">7. System Testing<a id="calibre_link-17" class="calibre3"></a><a id="calibre_link-18" class="calibre3"></a></h4>
<p class="p-p40">In this software is tested such that it works fine for different operating system.It is covered under the black box testing technique.<br class="calibre4" />
Example:</p>
<p class="p-p41">This include functional as well as non functional </p>
<p class="p-p43">testing</p>
<h4 class="p-p39">8. Stress Testing<a id="calibre_link-19" class="calibre3"></a><a id="calibre_link-20" class="calibre3"></a></h4>
<p class="p-p40">In this we gives unfavorable conditions to the system and check how they perform in those condition.<br class="calibre4" />
Example:</p>
<p class="p-p41">(a) Test cases that require maximum memory or other</p>
<p class="p-p42">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="s-t14">resources are executed</span>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p-p43">(b) Test cases that may cause thrashing in a virtual </p>
<p class="p-p42">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="s-t14">operating system</span>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p-p43">(c) Test cases that may cause excessive disk requirement</p>
<h4 class="p-p39">9. Performance Testing<a id="calibre_link-21" class="calibre3"></a><a id="calibre_link-22" class="calibre3"></a></h4>
<p class="p-p47"><span class="s-t16">It is designed to test the run-time performance of software within the context of an integrated system.It is used to test speed and effectiveness of program.<br class="calibre4" />
Example: </span>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p-p48"><span class="s-t17">Checking number of processor cycles.</span>&nbsp;</p>
